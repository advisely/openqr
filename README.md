## üöÄ Getting Started

Since this is a purely client-side application, there's no complex installation. You have two main options to run it:

**Option 1: Open the HTML File Directly**

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the project folder.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

**Option 2: Run a Local Server (Recommended for Development)**

For the best experience and to avoid any potential browser security issues with local files, run a simple web server:

1.  Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/openqr
    ```
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
5.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

**Stopping the Server**

- If you started the server directly in your terminal, you can stop it at any time by pressing `Ctrl+C`.
- If you see an `Address already in use` error, it means the port is occupied. You can free it up with the following command:
  ```bash
  fuser -k 8000/tcp
  ```

## üìñ Usage

1.  **Select Data Type:** Click on the tabs (URL, Text, Wi-Fi, vCard) to choose the type of QR code you want to create.
2.  **Enter Your Data:** Fill in the input fields for your chosen data type.
3.  **Customize (Optional):**
    *   Use the color pickers to change the QR code and background colors.
    *   Select an error correction level from the dropdown. Higher levels create more dense but more robust QR codes.
    *   Click "Add Logo" to upload an image to be placed in the center of the QR code. Use "Clear Logo" to remove it.
4.  **Download:** Once your QR code is generated, click the "Download QR Code" button to save it as a PNG file.

## üìù How to Use the App

Using the QR code generator is straightforward:

1.  **Enter a URL:** Type or paste the website link you want to turn into a QR code in the input field.
2.  **Customize Colors (Optional):**
    -   Click the **Color** swatch to change the QR code's color.
    -   Click the **Background** swatch to change the background color.
    The QR code will update in real-time with your changes.
3.  **Download Your QR Code:**
    -   Once you're happy with the QR code, click the **Download QR Code** button.
    -   The QR code will be saved to your computer as a `qrcode.png` file.
